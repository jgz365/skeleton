Debian has packaged 'helix' as 'hx'. You can symlink its runtime for the features that it offers OOTB.

'ln -s /usr/lib/hx/runtime $HOME/.config/helix'

Then check with 'hx --health'

It should then output:
"Runtime directories: /home/<username>/.config/helix/runtime;/usr/lib/hx/runtime"
"Runtime directory /home/<username>/.config/helix/runtime is symlinked to: /usr/lib/hx/runtime"

Note that this can be different on other distributions (like Arch Linux, as it is packaged as "helix", executable by doing 'helix')

Furthermore, check their official documentation for more information.
